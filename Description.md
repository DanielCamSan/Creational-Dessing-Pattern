**Problem:**
The main problem in the cretion of creditCard is that there are many types of creditCards and more can be implemented, we dont have rules
that separate the correct creation of new CreditCards

**Solution**
To solve the main problem, i use the creational dessign pattern Factory, where i can create many types of creditCard and assign each one
in the factory according to the string that i gave in the input of the factory method GetCreditCard.
